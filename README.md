# Java-Card-Game
Year 2 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Assignment.

This is essestially a top trumps card game in Java.

You are able to play against either computer players or real people (using the same computer (Not Distributed)) or both.

You are able to choose a 'Type' of computer player to play against. These are: Random, Smart and Predictable.

The random type will always choose a random attribute to play.
The smart type will always choose the highest attribute they have avaliable to play.
And the predictable type will always choose the same attribute.

How to play: 

First compile all the files using javac in CMD. (e.g. javac *.java)

Then run Main.class (e.g. java Main).

This will start the game and ask you for the starting paramaters (how many human players, how many computer players, type, etc).
